AMBuild is the build system AlliedMods uses to compile AMXModX, MetaMod: Source, and SourceMod.

Prerequisites:

1. Python 2.6 or newer.
2. Mercurial client.

Installing AMBuild:
1. Use Mercurial to clone the AMBuild repository: https://hg.alliedmods.net/ambuild/
2. Run python setup.py build
3. Run python setup.py install

To configure your project to use AMBuild, it helps if you have experience editing the Makefile for compiling Linux extensions by hand.

1. Open AMBuilder.  Near the bottom are several binary.AddSourceFiles entries.
   Basically, you'll want to edit the second of these lines to reference any additional files you need compiled.

   For instance, if you have a second file named natives.cpp, the line should look like this:
	binary.AddSourceFiles(['extension.cpp', 'natives.cpp'])

2. Edit product.version to have the extension's version number in it.

3. Edit buildbot/PackageScript.  About halfway down, these is a list named folders.  Add any folders you need created to this list using the format provided.
   Just below that is a section labeled Copy Files.  The first lines are the place where the where said files are located, the second lines are where they should be copied to.
   Any destination directories should have been added to the folders list.

4. Edit buildbot/Versioning.  Near the bottom is a line that just has PerformHgReversioning() on it.
   If you're using Mercurial for your repository, leave this alone.
   If you're using Git for your repository, change this to PerformGitReversioning()
   If you're not using a SCM or don't want versioning included in your extension, edit AMBuildScript and remove/comment out the following line
      AMBuild.Include(os.path.join('buildbot', 'Versioning'), globals)
